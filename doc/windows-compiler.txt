On https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases, there are multiple binary builds of mingw for windows available.
The differe in theire names like:

- release-mcf-seh-ucrt-rt
- release-posix-seh-msvcrt-rt
- release-posix-seh-ucrt-rt
- release-win32-seh-msvcrt-rt
- release-win32-seh-ucrt-rt

What is the difference?

ChatGPT:
Here’s what the different parts in those MinGW‑w64 build names mean:

**Architecture & Threading Model**
- mcf: A newer threading model offering performance improvements. It uses GCC’s internal gthread interface. Requires nonstandard support.
- posix: Enables POSIX-style threading, bringing compatibility with pthread. Essential if you're using C++11 threading features (std::thread, <mutex>, etc.). This uses the winpthreads library. 
- win32: Uses Windows native threading API. Doesn’t support POSIX threading, so C++11 thread features may not work as expected. 


**Exception Handling Model**
- seh (Structured Exception Handling): Default on x86‑64. Efficient and reliable for 64‑bit builds. 
- dwarf: Used in 32‑bit builds. Faster than SJLJ but has limitations when mixing with other compilers' code. 


**C Runtime Library**
- msvcrt: The traditional Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime (msvcrt.dll). Available system-wide but outdated—lacks C99/C11 features, limited UTF‑8 support, and includes compatibility quirks. 
- ucrt: The Universal C Runtime introduced with Windows 10 and used by modern MSVC toolchains. Standards‑compliant (C99/11), better MSVC compatibility—but may require redistributable for older Windows. 

Note: MinGW‑w64 v12 and later even defaults to UCRT unless otherwise configured; switching CRT requires rebuilding the entire toolchain including headers and libraries. 




Finally, I ended with those, which seems to work (but requires Compiler Flag "-static-libstdc++")

Note: 
The *posix* variants, wasn't working at all. 
The others were not tested in combination with the (obviosly mandatory) "-static-libstdc++" flag.
